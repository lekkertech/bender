# Slack Channel Bot — Docs-Only Scaffold

This repository folder contains documentation to build a Slack bot that responds to messages in channels (via mentions and/or keyword triggers). It is framework-agnostic and covers both Socket Mode and Events API approaches.

## Capabilities
- Respond to `@app` mentions in public/private channels
- Optionally react to keywords in channel messages
- Pluggable handlers for commands, help, and automations
- Works with Slack Bolt (Node/Python) or any HTTP framework

## Quick Links
- Setup: `docs/SETUP.md`
- Architecture: `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
- Configuration: `docs/CONFIG.md`
- Deploy: `docs/DEPLOY.md`
- Security: `docs/SECURITY.md`
- Testing: `docs/TESTING.md`
- Troubleshooting: `docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md`
- Operations Runbook: `docs/OPERATIONS.md`

## Quick Start (high level)
1. Create a Slack app (Bot user) and install it to your workspace. See `docs/SETUP.md`.
2. Add required scopes and subscribe to events (`app_mention`, `message.channels`, etc.).
3. Pick one transport:
   - Socket Mode (no public URL) with an App Token (`xapp-…`).
   - Events API over HTTPS (public URL) and verify signatures.
4. Configure environment variables: see `docs/CONFIG.md`.
5. Implement handlers for mentions/messages using your preferred framework.
6. Deploy and test using the checklists in `docs/TESTING.md`.
